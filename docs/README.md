# Documentation (`docs/`)

## Purpose

Generated and compiled documentation for the AI-Optimized FreeRTOS Codebase. This directory holds implementation-level documentation that is produced after components are built, as opposed to the raw architecture specifications.

## Relationship to `resources/`

| Directory | Role | When Created |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `resources/` | Raw architecture specifications and design documents | Before implementation |
| `docs/` | Compiled implementation docs, API references, build guides | After/during implementation |

## Future Contents

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `architecture/` | Compiled architecture diagrams and cross-reference docs |
| `api/` | Generated API documentation (Doxygen or similar) |
| `guides/` | Build guides, debugging walkthroughs, deployment procedures |

## Current State

**Skeleton only** — documentation will be populated as building blocks are implemented in future iterations.
