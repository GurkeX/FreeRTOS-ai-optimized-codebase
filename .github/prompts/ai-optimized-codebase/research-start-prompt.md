Hey, so I want to create my own ai optimized free Rtos codebase.
In #file:Excal-6-AI-Optimized-Codebases.png you can see a process of creating an AI optimized code base, all the factors that play within it in order for you to get a general idea of what this even is.

### My Specific Setup

- Rpi pico w (controller running the code)
- pico probe debugging setup
- FreeRtos as framework

in this session,

**Note:** Make sure to first take a peek into the overview files of the other defined building blocks so we can maintain consistency and identify integration points.
