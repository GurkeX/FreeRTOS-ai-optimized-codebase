# .clangd — clangd/IntelliSense configuration for RP2040 cross-compilation
#
# This file configures how clangd (Language Server Protocol) handles code completion,
# diagnostics, and navigation for the AI-Optimized FreeRTOS project.
#
# It works transparently across different build environments (Docker, CI)
# by telling clangd to use compile_commands.json (which is auto-fixed after build).
#
# Reference: https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd/Configuration.html

CompileFlags:
  # Use the auto-generated compilation database
  # (This is fixed by the post-build step to handle Docker paths)
  CompilationDatabase: build/

# Performance tuning
Index:
  # Reindex on reopening workspace to pick up new symbols
  StandardLibrary: false

Diagnostics:
  # Suppress some false positives from cross-compiler sysroot
  # These will typically disappear once compile_commands.json is fixed
  Suppress:
    - "redeclaration"
    - "unknown-type"

# Code hints (optional — disable if noise)
InlayHints:
  Enabled: false
