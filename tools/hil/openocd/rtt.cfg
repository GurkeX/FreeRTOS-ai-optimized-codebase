# OpenOCD RTT configuration for AI-Optimized FreeRTOS
# Usage: openocd -f tools/hil/openocd/pico-probe.cfg -f tools/hil/openocd/rtt.cfg
#
# After starting, connect to:
#   - TCP port 9090: RTT Channel 0 (text stdio / printf)
#   - TCP port 9091: RTT Channel 1 (binary tokenized logs)
#
# NOTE: rtt setup must be before init; rtt start / rtt server must be AFTER init.
# This file only configures the pre-init setup. Post-init commands are passed
# via -c arguments by the pipeline (see openocd_utils.py start_openocd_server).

# Search for SEGGER RTT control block in RP2040 SRAM
# 0x20000000 = SRAM base, 0x42000 = 264KB SRAM size
rtt setup 0x20000000 0x42000 "SEGGER RTT"
